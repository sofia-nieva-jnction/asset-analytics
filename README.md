To run the streamlit app locally:

- Create virtual environment (optional)
- Install requirements.txt ("pip install -r requirements.txt")
- run "streamlit run analysis_app.py"

A tab will be open in your browser where you can see the app.

Streamlit apps automatically update whenever you save changes to the Python script, so you don't need to restart the server manually. Just click the "Rerun" button on the top right corner of the app

Streamlit code is in analysis_app.py, funtions to plot and load some tables in utils.py and the rest of the files in the repo are the csv with the data
